# WheelController
Plugin for RBR which adds ability to use wheel buttons to navigate around in menus etc.

### Why?
Because I'm used to navigate through menus with wheel buttons on other rally games, but RBR doesn't have that, so I got lazy for always grabbing keyboard, and added support for it through plugin.

# How to install
1. Download latest release from [here!](https://github.com/JokkeeZ/WheelController/releases)
2. Extract/unzip the downloaded zip file to the game installation directory.
3. DONE!

# It's a mess
Actually the first thing I have ever created in C++!
